# Programing-Fundamental
Jackpot Game based on C++.

EXPLANATION:

•	This project is based on the basics of C++ programming language.

•	In this project we have made a game named ‘JACKPOT GAME’.

WORKING:

•	When we run the program, it gives us an option to press‘s’ to start the game.

•	By pressing‘s’ it will generate 3 random numbers in a row.

•	If all 3 numbers are same we won the jackpot.

•	If any 1 number or all 3 numbers are different from each other, program will ask us to press ‘g’ to generate all numbers again.

•	Likewise if we didn’t get all numbers same again and again, we will not get jackpot.
